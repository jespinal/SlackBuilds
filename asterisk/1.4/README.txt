Asterisk 1.4.X
--------------

Even if this version of Asterisk has been marked as EOL, it still offers
exceptional stability and reliability. This is basicly the kind of software
that "just works" and you can rely on.

Notes:
This SlackBuild asumes that you have installed the other ('common' directory)
packages.

I've been informed that h323 (chan_h323) will soon be deprecated in favor of
ooh323. A lot of work has been done in ooh323.

Lines regarding H323Plus will be removed from script.
