Asterisk 1.4.X
--------------

Even if this version of Asterisk has been marked as EOL, it still offers
exceptional stability and reliability. This is basicly the kind of software
that "just works" and you can rely on.

Notes:
This SlackBuild asumes that you have installed the other ('common' directory)
packages.

It slightly modifies the configure script and the chan_h323 files so you can use
the latest version of PTLib and H323Plus (Former OpenH323). A simple patch has been
submitted that might render this changes obsoletes, and the SlackBuild will be
modified then.
