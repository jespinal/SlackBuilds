Asterisk 1.8.X
--------------

This is the cutting edge, state of the art version of Asterisk so far. A lot
of improvements have been done, and resources are focused toward this branch.

You should really take a look at it as it has several new features as well.


Notes:
This SlackBuild asumes that you have installed the other ('common' directory)
packages.
